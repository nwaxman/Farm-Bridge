	<h2><a name="description1"> Example: CSA Description </a></h2>
		<p class="oblique"> 
		Grand Street CSA is a partnership between residents of Grand Street and other neighboring blocks on Manhattan's lower east side, and Woodbridge Farm in Salem, 		
		Connecticut. We are member-run and not-for-profit, organized in 2008 solely for the purpose of bringing fresh produce to our community.
	</p>
	<h2><a name="description2"> Example: Membership Agreement </a></h2>
	<p class="oblique">
	The Park Slope CSA is a member-run all volunteer organization, so we do ask for a small amount of your time to make things run smoothly. Full share members are 
		required to work 5 hours during the season. This means helping out for 2 shifts at the distribution site. EOW members work 2.5 hours during the season, or one 
		shift at distribution. You can sign up for whatever date and time works best with your schedule.
	</p>
		<p class="oblique"> 
			Cost for the 2009 season was $590 for a full share and $340 for a half share. Each membership includes a $15 admin fee to the CSA that supports our subsidy 		
			of a few low-income shares, as well as for the few supplies we use at distribution (scales, signs, rags).
	</p>

	<p class="oblique"> 
Windflower Farm is a small, organic farm in upstate New York, nestled on 38 acres in the Taconic Hill country between Saratoga Springs and the Vermont border. It's an area made beautiful by the mix of small farms, open fields and wooded landscapes.</p>
